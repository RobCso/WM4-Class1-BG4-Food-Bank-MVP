>>>>>> An explanation of what you have developed and what is your global issue.

We have developed a website and business plan for a social enterprise attempting to demonstrate an innovative model for dealing with the immediate and long term concerns of the cost of living crisis and the consequent rise in food banks.

>>>>>> What is the purpose of your product? (convince, inform, tell a story, etc.) Relate this to the global issue your team has chosen.

The purpose of our product is to use modern technology such as social media and data collection techniques to generate knowledge and mapping of current trends in the cost of living crisis and to turn that data into a saleable asset whose profits can then be used for the creation of a chain of food banks.

>>>>> Who is the target market of your end product?

The target market are those immediately affected by the cost of living crisis and those on the margins of society who require assistance through the use of foodbanks. Additionally, we are interested in media and local government agencies who would be interested in an independent data collection service and would be willing to pay for up to date and relevant information.
